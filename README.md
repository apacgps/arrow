# Arrow

Arrow is the codename for workshops led by Microsoft partners designed to help customers with the [Application build and deploy part of their DevOps strategy and practice](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-leverage-partners-your-devops-strategy-practice-part-vito-chin). 

Arrow relates to the focused nature of these workshops, which is 1:1 between a partner and a customer. It also depicts the focused nature of the workshop content, which is customised based on a customer team's (customers are asked to involve a specific application team in the workshop) high level scenario.

This document goes through the high level agenda of the workshop as well as a few example customizations based on the high level agenda.

# High level agenda

* Build environment setup (teams, permissions), GitHub / Azure DevOps / self-hosted
* Connect build environment to Azure
* Source code hosting and considerations (monorepo, multi-repo)
* Example pipeline and workflow based on target Azure workload
* Retrospective and next steps 

# Examples

## Node.js, GitHub Free, Azure App Service

* The App is a Node.js web application and the customer is interested in deploying it to Azure App Service.
* The customer prefers to use GitHub Free after comparing it with Azure DevOps. Theyâ€™re OK with the 2000 minutes hosted agent time for now.

Partner Customised Workshop Agenda:

*	Start with GitHub Free, discuss Organizations and teams (see [The GitHub Guide to Organizations](https://resources.github.com/downloads/github-guide-to-organizations.pdf) and [Organizations and teams - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations)) (30 mins)
*	[Connect GitHub environment to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Cwindows) (30 mins)
*	Discuss source code hosting structure (monorepo, multi-repo) (30 mins)
*	Demo [Node.js to Azure App Service workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/deploying-to-your-cloud-provider/deploying-to-azure/deploying-nodejs-to-azure-app-service) (1 hour)
*	Retrospective and next steps (30 mins)

## Java Spring Boot, GitHub Enterprise, Spring Cloud, AKS

*	The App is a Spring Boot application, and the customer is interested in deploying it to Azure Spring Cloud or Azure Kubernetes Service.
*	The customer prefers to use GitHub Enterprise with Advanced Security after comparing it with Azure DevOps.
*	The customer is comparing between Azure Spring Cloud and Azure Kubernetes Service. They want to understand more about the CI/CD.

Partner Customised Workshop Agenda:

*	Start with GitHub Enterprise, discuss Organizations, Teams and Advanced Security (see [The GitHub Guide to Organizations](https://resources.github.com/downloads/github-guide-to-organizations.pdf) and [Organizations and teams - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations)) (30 mins)
*	[GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) (15mins)
*	[Connect GitHub environment to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Cwindows) (30 mins)
*	Discuss source code hosting structure (monorepo, multi-repo) (30 mins)
*	Demo [Java to Azure Spring Cloud](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/spring-cloud/how-to-github-actions?pivots=programming-language-java) and [Java to Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/deploying-to-your-cloud-provider/deploying-to-azure/deploying-to-azure-kubernetes-service) (1 hour)
*	Retrospective and next steps (30 mins)

## Azure Kubernetes Service apps deployment

* Deploy an AKS cluster, set up azure cli and configure kubectl to connect to your cluster following this guide: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough
* Activate the HTTP Routing addon in your AKS cluster following this guide: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/http-application-routing
* Using your GitHub account fork this repo into your account (or use your own GitHub repository with your own app): https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-voting-app-redis
* Deploy using GitHub Actions into Azure Kubernetes Service: https://azure.github.io/kube-labs/1-github-actions.html#objective-of-the-lab
