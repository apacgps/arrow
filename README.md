# Arrow

Arrow is the codename for workshops led by Microsoft partners designed to help customers with the [Application build and deploy part of their DevOps strategy and practice](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-leverage-partners-your-devops-strategy-practice-part-vito-chin). 

Arrow relates to the focused nature of these workshops, which is 1:1 between a partner and a customer. It also depicts the focused nature of the workshop content, which is customised based on a customer team's (customers are asked to involve a specific application team in the workshop) high level scenario.

This document goes through the high level agenda of the workshop as well as a few example customizations based on the high level agenda.

# High level agenda

* Build environment setup (teams, permissions), GitHub / Azure DevOps / self-hosted
* Connect build environment to Azure
* Source code hosting and considerations (monorepo, multi-repo)
* Example pipeline and workflow based on target Azure workload
* Retrospective and next steps 

# Examples

## Node.js, GitHub Free, Azure App Service

* The App is a Node.js web application and the customer is interested in deploying it to Azure App Service.
* The customer prefers to use GitHub Free after comparing it with Azure DevOps. Theyâ€™re OK with the 2000 minutes hosted agent time for now.

Partner Customised Workshop Agenda:

*	Start with GitHub Free, discuss Organizations and teams (see [The GitHub Guide to Organizations](https://resources.github.com/downloads/github-guide-to-organizations.pdf) and [Organizations and teams - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations)) (30 mins)
*	[Connect GitHub environment to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Cwindows) (30 mins)
*	Discuss source code hosting structure (monorepo, multi-repo) (30 mins)
*	Demo [Node.js to Azure App Service workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/deploying-to-your-cloud-provider/deploying-to-azure/deploying-nodejs-to-azure-app-service) (1 hour)
*	Retrospective and next steps (30 mins)

## Java Spring Boot, GitHub Enterprise, Spring Cloud, AKS

*	The App is a Spring Boot application, and the customer is interested in deploying it to Azure Spring Cloud or Azure Kubernetes Service.
*	The customer prefers to use GitHub Enterprise with Advanced Security after comparing it with Azure DevOps.
*	The customer is comparing between Azure Spring Cloud and Azure Kubernetes Service. They want to understand more about the CI/CD.

Partner Customised Workshop Agenda:

*	Start with GitHub Enterprise, discuss Organizations, Teams and Advanced Security (see [The GitHub Guide to Organizations](https://resources.github.com/downloads/github-guide-to-organizations.pdf) and [Organizations and teams - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations)) (30 mins)
*	[GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) (15mins)
*	[Connect GitHub environment to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Cwindows) (30 mins)
*	Discuss source code hosting structure (monorepo, multi-repo) (30 mins)
*	Demo [Java to Azure Spring Cloud](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/spring-cloud/how-to-github-actions?pivots=programming-language-java) and [Java to Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/deploying-to-your-cloud-provider/deploying-to-azure/deploying-to-azure-kubernetes-service) (1 hour)
*	Retrospective and next steps (30 mins)

## Intelligent Cloud Native Apps

* The backend service is written in ASP.Net, and the customer is interested in deploying it to Cloud Native services such as Azure Kubernetes Service or Azure Container Apps. 
* The customer wants to understand the benefits of using Azure API Management to manage their APIs.
* The customer is comparing between Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure Container Apps. They want to understand more about deploying AI services and models to the container services.

Partner Customized Workshop Agenda:

* Discuss about Azure cloud native services across Containers, Serverless, APIS, and Data (30min)
* Compare the differences between Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure Container Apps (15min)
* Discuss the advantages of using API Management, API policies and the developer portal (15min)
* Discuss the use of Azure Cognitive Search and how it can be integrated to Azure Functions (30min)
* Discuss the use of Azure Machine Learning and automated ML, and how models can be deployed to AKS or other container services (30min)

* Demo an operational AKS Cluster, and it's autoscaling, autohealing capability (15min)
* Demo Azure API Management, API policies, and the developer portal (15min)
* Demo Azure Cognitive Search and how it can be used to search indexed documents (15min)
